    Adds automatic job splitting to
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseExperiment` for execution of
    experiments with a larger number of circuits than can be run in a single
    job on the target backend. This enables running large experiments on
    legacy and 3rd-party Qiskit backends that don't handle job splitting
    automatically.
