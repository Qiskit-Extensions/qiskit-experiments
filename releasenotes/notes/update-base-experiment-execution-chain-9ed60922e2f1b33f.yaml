    The execution chain of :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.base_experiment.BaseExperiment`
    has been updated with some flexibility. The new feature will benefit experiment developers
    who need to modify the standard job execution and analysis workflow.

    With this change, following three methods are newly introduced.

    - :py:meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.base_experiment.BaseExperiment#_pre_transpile_action`
    - :py:meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.base_experiment.BaseExperiment#_post_transpile_action`
    - :py:meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.base_experiment.BaseExperiment#_post_analysis_action`

    These methods allow a developer to insert extra data processing routine (somewhat of hooks)
    in between circuit generation and result data generation.
    This feature increases the flexibility of job execution.

    In addition, :py:meth:`run_transpile` method is added to all experiment classes.
    This returns a list of quantum circuits to execute on the given backend.
