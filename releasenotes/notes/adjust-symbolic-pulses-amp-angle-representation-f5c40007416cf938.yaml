    Qiskit Terra 0.23.0, began phasing out support of complex parameters
    in the Pulse module. Mainly, all library symbolic pulses were converted
    from complex amplitude representation to a duo of real (float) parameters
    (amp, angle). To avoid problems, Qiskit Experiments adopted this convention.
    
    The :class:`.FixedFrequencyTransmon` library now includes an ``angle`` parameter
    for every pulse, and the default values of ``amp`` are set to float instead
    of complex.
    
    With the exception of ``HalfAngleCal``, all experiments should continue
    function as they did before (even with complex ``amp``).
    ``HalfAngleCal`` was changed from updating
    the complex amplitude of the pulse, to updating the angle. When used with
    the ``FixedFrequencyTransmon`` library, it will continue to work seamlessly 
    in the new representation. However, when the experiment is used with custom
    built pulses, which rely on the old convention of complex ``amp`` (with no
    angle parameter) - the experiment will fail. Most reasonable cases will raise
    a detailed ``CalibrationError`` explaining the change and the way to adjust
    to it. Some edge cases, like a custom built pulse with an ``angle`` parameter
    which doesn't conform to the naming convention of Qiskit Terra's 
    ``ScalableSymbolicPulse`` class - will result in the updating of the wrong
    parameter.
