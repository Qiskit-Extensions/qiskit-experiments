    A new data processing node :class:`.Discriminator` is added. This node
    wraps a pre-trained discriminator so that discrimination can be built
    into the data processing chain. The discriminator node is initialialized
    from a discriminator or list thereof which are objects that must have a
    predict method :code:`predict(x) -> y`  as is common in SKlearn. Here,
    :code:`x` is a list of IQ points and :code:`y` are the labels assigned to
    each point.
