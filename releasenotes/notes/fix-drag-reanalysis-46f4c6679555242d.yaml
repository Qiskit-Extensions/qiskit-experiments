upgrade:
  - |
    An analysis option `reps` in :class:`DragCalAnalysis` was dropped.
    Now analysis is bootstrapped with circuit metadata and setting this value 
    no longer impacts the analysis result. 
    This upgrade doesn't introduce any breaking API change for existing experiments.
fixes:
  - |
    A bug of redoing :class:`DragCalAnalysis.run` generates wrong fit models
    was fixed.
