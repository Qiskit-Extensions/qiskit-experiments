    The variables `__drive_freq_parameter__` and `__readout_freq_parameter__`
    have been removed from `Calibrations`. These variables were given special
    treatment which is inconsistent with the framework. To replace them a
    mechanism to define and add parameters without a schedule has been added to
    the basis gate library. This has the added benefit of making the API of 
    frequency calibration experiments more consistent with the other calibration
    experiments.
