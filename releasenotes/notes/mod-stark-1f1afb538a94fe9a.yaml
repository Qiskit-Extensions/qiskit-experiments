    New experiment :class:`.StarkRamseyXY` has been added.
    This is a variant of the :class:`.RamseyXY` experiment that characterizes 
    the qubit frequency offset under a Stark tone drive.
  - |
    New experiment :class:`.StarkRamseyFast` has been added.
    This is a variant of the :class:`.StarkRamseyXY` experiment to estimate
    the required tone amplitude to cause a particular Stark shift.
    This experiment scans tone amplitude while fixing the Stark tone length,
    and the fit the result with the dedicated fitter :class:`.StarkRamseyFastAnalysis`.
