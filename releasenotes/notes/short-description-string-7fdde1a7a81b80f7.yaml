    Added minimal working code examples to the API pages for each
    experiment, especially in characterizaion experiments.
    The minimal working code example is a code snippet which users can copy
    and paste to run the experiment. Users must provide a backend in the code
    example. As a default, the backend is a simulator such as
    AerSimulator(FakePerth). In some experiments, the backend is an IBM real
    device due to the backend.default() dependence of the code example.
