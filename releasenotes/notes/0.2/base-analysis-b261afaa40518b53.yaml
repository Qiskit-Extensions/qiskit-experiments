features:

    Added the ``replace_results`` kwarg to
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.run` with default
    value of ``replace_results=False``.
    
    If analysis is run with ``replace_results=True`` then any analysis results
    and figures in the experiment data will be cleared and replaced with the
    new analysis results. Saving this experiment data will replace any
    previously saved data in a database service using the same experiment ID.

    If analysis is run with ``replace_results=False`` and the experiment data
    being analyzed has already been saved to a database service, or already
    contains analysis results or figures, a copy with a unique experiment ID
    will be returned containing only the new analysis results and figures.
    This data can then be saved as its own experiment to a database service.

    Added a :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.set_options`
    method and :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.options`
    property to the :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis` class
    to store and retrieve any analysis options in the state of the analysis
    instance.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.run` to run
    asynchronously using the 
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.add_analysis_callback`.
    Previously analysis was only run asynchronously if it was done as part of
    an experiments :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseExperiment.run`.
developer:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis` class has
    been changed to be an initialized class.
    
    This class now stores its set analysis options using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.set_options` and
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.options` and
    ``_default_options`` methods.
    The signature of the abstract method ``_run_analysis`` that must be
    implemented by subclasses has been changed to remove the ``**kwargs``.

    Note that the state of this class should only be used to store option
    values and derived configuration. The
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.run` and
    ``_run_analysis`` methods should not change the state of the instance.
