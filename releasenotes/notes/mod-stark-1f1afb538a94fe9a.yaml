    New module :mod:`qiskit_experiments.library.stark` has been added. 
    This module contains characterization experiments utilizing the Stark shift
    for spectroscopy. This allows experimentalist to characterize qubit parameter
    in the vicinity of the qubit frequency, even though the qubit doesn't allow
    frequency modulation, i.e. fixed-qubit frequency architecture.

    New experiment :class:`.StarkRamseyXY` has been added.
    This is a variant of :class:`RamseyXY` experiment that characterizes 
    the qubit frequency offset under the Stark tone drive.
