    With the impending deprecation of the :mod:`qiskit_ibm_provider` package, support for
    :mod:`qiskit_ibm_provider` is now deprecated and will be removed
    in the next release. Users should migrate to :mod:`qiskit_ibm_runtime` following the
    `runtime migration guide
    <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/migration-guides/qiskit-runtime-from-provider>`_.
    :mod:`qiskit_ibm_runtime` is not listed as a dependency for compatibility reasons, but users
    will need it to run experiments on IBM backends.
