    two analysis callback functions that are added to the experiment data as follows.

    1. An experiment transition callback. This is a function that determines relative changes to
    the experiment index. For example, if the next experiment in the chain is to be executed then
    this function returns 1. However, if the current experiment is to be repeated then this
    function will return 0.

    2. A callback to launch the next experiment based on the value of the experiment index.
