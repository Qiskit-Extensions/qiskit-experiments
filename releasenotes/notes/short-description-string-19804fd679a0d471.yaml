    Added minimal working code examples to the API pages for each experiment,
    especially in characterizaion experiments. The minimal working code example
    is a code snippet which users can copy and paste to run the experiment.
    Users are required to specify a backend in the code example. As a default,
    the backend is a simulator such as `GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=27)`.
    In some experiments, the backend is an IBM real device due to the
    `backend.defaults()` dependence of the code example.
