    Cross resonance Hamiltonian tomography experiment is added to the library.
    This experiment estimates IX, IY, IZ, ZX, ZY, ZZ term coefficient of
    the cross resonance Hamiltonian.

    For single tone cross resonance, :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.\
    cr_hamiltonian.CrossResonanceHamiltonian` class is available.
    For echoed cross resonance, :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.\
    cr_hamiltonian.EchoedCrossResonanceHamiltonian` class is available.

    See experiment class documentation for details.
