    A :class:`.BaseCalibrations` class is introduced as an abstract base class
    of Qiskit Experiments calibrations. All calibration subclasses must inherit 
    from the abstract base class and implement all defined methods.
    All calibration experiment classes can rely on the methods defined in 
    :class:`.BaseCalibrations`. However, custom methods implemented in a
    particular subclass may not necessarily be implemented in general and should
    not be used in calibration experiments.
