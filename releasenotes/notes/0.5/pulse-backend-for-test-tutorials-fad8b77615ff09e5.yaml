features:
  - |
    Added pulse simulator backends :class:`.PulseBackend` and subclass :class:`.SingleTransmonTestBackend`
    that use Qiskit Dynamics to simulate pulse schedules included in 
    the calibrations attached to transpiled quantum circuits. The backend is capable of 
    simulating level one (IQ) and level two (counts) data. The main purpose of this 
    backend is to make the test suite more realistic and allow for tutorials that 
    do not require hardware backends.
issues:
  - |
    The :class:`.PulseBackend` only supports single qubit operations and will be upgraded in the future.
deprecations:
  - |
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.test.mock_iq_helpers.MockIQRabiHelper` is now deprecated and
    should be replaced with :class:`.SingleTransmonTestBackend`.
