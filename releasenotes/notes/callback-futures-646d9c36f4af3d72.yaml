    Improves handling of analysis callbacks in :meth:`.ExperimentData`.
    Logging information on execution of analysis callbacks in an experiment
    can enabled by setting the log level to DEBUG.

    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.cancel_callbacks` method to allow cancelling
    pending analysis callbacks. Note that analysis callbacks that have already
    started running cannot be cancelled.
