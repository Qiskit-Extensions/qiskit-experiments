About Qiskit Experiment
=======================

Qiskit Experiments provides for a fundamental framework to perform quantum physics experiments
along with a library of standard experiments for quantum characterization, verification, validation and calibration.
This also supports the application platform interface connecting to the remote database for the experiment result management.
Experimentalits can also develop own experiment library on top of the experiment framework for their inhouse quantum systems.
