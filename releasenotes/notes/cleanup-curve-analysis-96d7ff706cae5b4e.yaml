    :class:`CurveAnalysis` is now a subclass of :class:`BaseCurveAnalysis`.
    This change has been made to introduce multi-grouped curve analysis,
    see qiskit-experiments/#737 for details.
    
    According to this update, several protected methods that are
    originally designed to be overridden by subclasses have been deprecated or upgraded.
    Check the following list of changes you may need to upgrade your analysis subclass.
    
    - :meth:`CurveAnalysis._generate_fit_guesses`
    
    The signature of method has been upgraded. Now this method should be called with
    ``curve_data`` to get the curve data instead of calling ``self._data()`` which has been deprecated.
    
    - :meth:`CurveAnalysis._data`
    
    This method has been deprecated. 
    
    - :meth:`CurveAnalysis._extra_database_entry`
    
    This method has been deprecated. You can directly override 
    new method :meth:`CurveAnalysis._create_analysis_results`.
    
    - :class:`FitData`
    
    Fit data dataclass is now created with :attr:`x_data` and :attr:`y_data`
    so that you can retrieve the data used for the fitting along with the outcome parameters.

    See :ref:`curve_analysis_overview` for the overview of new curve analysis base class.
