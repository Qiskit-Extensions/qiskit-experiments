    Fixes a bug in :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.StandardRB` and
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.InterleavedRB` where the variance in
    the estimated error per Clifford did not scale correctly with the number
    of sampled RB sequences.

    See issue https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments/issues/428
    for details.
