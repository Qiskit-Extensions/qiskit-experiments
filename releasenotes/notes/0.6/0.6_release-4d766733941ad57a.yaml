    Qiskit Experiments 0.6 introduces numerous features and improvements. It is compatible with
    Qiskit 1.0. Notable changes include: refactoring the analysis results to a pandas
    :class:`~pandas:pandas.DataFrame`-based :class:`.AnalysisResultTable`, the ability to add
    artifacts of serializable data to :class:`.ExperimentData`, and refactoring curve fit data into
    a new :class:`~pandas:pandas.DataFrame`-based :class:`.ScatterTable` container that is
    stored by default as an artifact in :class:`.ExperimentData` along with the summary of fit
    results. New experiments include :class:`.StarkP1Spectroscopy`, :class:`.StarkRamseyXY`, and
    :class:`.StarkRamseyXYAmpScan`. :class:`.StandardRB` and :class:`.InterleavedRB` were
    significantly improved. The supported provider for running jobs on IBM backends is now
    :external+qiskit_ibm_runtime:doc:`qiskit-ibm-runtime <index>`. Using 
    :external+qiskit_ibm_provider:doc:`qiskit-ibm-provider <index>` is still supported
    but its use is deprecated.
