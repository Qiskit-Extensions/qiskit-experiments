    Introducing the following methods to :class: `BaseExperiment`
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    :math: `BaseExperiment._max_circuit`: This method will calculate the
    maximum number of circuits that can be included in a single job.
    :math:`BaseExperiment.job_info`: This method will give information about
    job distribution for the experiment on a specific.
  - |
    Refactor :math:`BaseExperiment._run_jobs`
    ----------------------------------------
    :math:`BaseExperiment._run_jobs`:The existing _run_jobs() method will be 
    refactored to make use of the _max_circuits() method. This change will
    enhance code readability and maintainability by segregating the logic
    related to job distribution from the actual job execution logic.
  - |
    Added unit test method to :class:`TestFramework`
    ---------------------------------------------
    :math:`TestFramework.test_max_circuits` and
    :math:`TestFramework.test_job_info` these tests ensure that added methods 
    functioning correctly.
