    The ``experiment_data`` kwarg has been removed from the 
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiment.framework.BaseExperiment.run` method of
    experiments. To combine data from multiple executions you can manually
    add data from one :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData`
    container to another using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.add_data` method
    eg. ``expdata2.add_data(expdata1.data())``
