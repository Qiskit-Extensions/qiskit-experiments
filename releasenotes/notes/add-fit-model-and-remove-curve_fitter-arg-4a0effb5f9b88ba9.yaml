features:
  - |
    :attr:`CurveAnalysis.fit_model` and :attr:`CurveAnalysis.parameters` have been
    added to the curve analysis and its subclasses. These properties return
    :class:`FitModel` instance that represents a fit function of the analysis
    and parameters to be fit with the analysis, respectively.
  - |
    New classes :class:`SingleFitFunction` and :class:`CompositeFitFunction` have been
    added to the curve analysis module. These classes abstract the curve definition
    hard-coded in the class attribute :attr:`CurveAnalysis.__series__` as a
    Python function-like object. This may help user to grasp the fitting model
    without reading the code.
upgrade:
  - |
    Analysis option `curve_fitter` of the :class:`CurveAnalysis` has been removed
    because of the serialization problem. To use custom curve fitting library,
    one must directly override the class method :meth:`CurveAnalysis.curve_fit`.
developer:
  - |
    :meth:`CurveAnalysis.curve_fit` has been added to the curve analysis and
    its subclasses. Now you can directly access the core fitting code
    with bare numpy arrays representing data to be fit.
    This may help debugging of new fit functions.
