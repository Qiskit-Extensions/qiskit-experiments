def get_processor(

) -> DataProcessor:
    """Get a DataProcessor that produces a continuous signal given the options.

    Args:
        experiment_data: The experiment data that holds all the data and metadata needed
             to determine the data processor to use to process the data for analysis.
        analysis_options: The analysis options with which to analyze the data. The options that
             are relevant for the configuration of a data processor are:
             - normalization (bool): A boolean to specify if the data should be normalized to
               the interval [0, 1]. The default is True. This option is only relevant if
               kerneled data is used.
             - outcome (string): The measurement outcome that will be passed to a Probability node.
             - restless_threshold (float): If (repetition delay / T1) is below a given threshold for
               all physical qubit T1 values the experiment is recognized as a restless experiment and
               will be analyzed accordingly.
        index: The index of the job for which to get a data processor.

    Returns:
        An instance of DataProcessor capable of processing the data for the corresponding job.

    Notes:
        The following relevant arguments are extracted from the experiment_data metadata run options:
            - meas_level (MeasLevel): The measurement level of the data to process.
            - meas_return (MeasReturnType): The measurement return (single or avg) of the data to process.
            - init_qubits (bool): If False, the qubits are not reset to the ground state after a measurement.
            - physical qubits: The physical qubits used in the experiment.
            - memory (bool): If True, single-shot measurement bitstrings are returned.
            - rep_delay (float): The delay between a measurement and the subsequent circuit.

        In addition, the following argument is extracted from the experiment_data:
            - t1_values (List[float]): The T1 values of the physical qubits at the time of the experiment.

    Raises:
        DataProcessorError: if the measurement level is not supported.
        DataProcessorError: if no single-shot memory is present but the run options suggest that a
                            restless experiment was run.
