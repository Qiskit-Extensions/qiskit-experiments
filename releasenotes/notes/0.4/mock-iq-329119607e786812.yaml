    The class :class:`~qiskit_experiments.test.MockIQBackend` for testing has been updated to support
    multiple qubits. It now takes lists of IQ cluster centers and widths as input,
    and specific backends are now defined as subclasses of
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.test.MockIQExperimentHelper`.
  - |
    Adds two new classes, :class:`~qiskit_experiments.test.mock_iq_helpers.MockIQParallelExperimentHelper` 
    and :class:`~qiskit_experiments.test.mock_iq_backend.MockIQParallelBackend`
    for running parallel experiments on the mock IQ backend.
