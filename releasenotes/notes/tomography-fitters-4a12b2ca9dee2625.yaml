    The ``scipy_linear_lstsq`` and ``scipy_gaussian_lstsq`` fitters for the
    :class:`.StateTomographyAnalysis` and :class:`.ProcessTomographyAnalysis`
    classes have been deprecated.

    The unconstrained least-squares fitting performed by ``scipy_linear_lstsq``
    is equivalent to the :func:`.linear_inversion` fitter, but with worse
    performance and memory usage. For weighted least-squares fitting the CVXPY
    fitters :func:`.cvxpy_linear_lstsq` or :func:`.cvxpy_gaussian_lstsq` should
    be used instead. The CVXPY fitters also support PSD and CPTP constraints
    unlike the SciPy fitters.
