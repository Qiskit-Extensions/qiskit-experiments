    The behavior of the ``seed`` initialization kwarg of the
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.StandardRB`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.InterleavedStandardRB`,
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.QuantumVolume` experiments has
    been modified.

    In the new version the ``seed`` value is used as to initialize a Numpy
    random number generator object as ``numpy.random.default_rng(seed=seed)``
    each time the experiments ``circuits`` method is called. This change means
    that using a fixed seed value will result in the same circuits being
    generated each time an experiment is run, if no other
    experiment options are changed.

    To generate different new random circuits each time an experiment is run
    the (default) value of ``seed=None`` should be used. To reproduce
    equivalent functionality to the previous version behavior of differnet
    circuits being generated each time ``run`` is called with a fixed seed
    you must now set a new fixed seed value between each call to ``run``
    using ``experiment.set_experiment_options(seed=value)``.
