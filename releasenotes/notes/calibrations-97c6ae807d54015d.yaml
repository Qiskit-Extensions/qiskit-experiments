    Qisit experiments 0.2 introduces several new features and changes in the
    Calibration Module.
features:
  - |
    * Each calibration experiment is now a sub-class of a characterization
      experiment. The calibration version of the experiment is created from the
      characterization experiment and the new :class:`BaseCalibrationExperiment`.
      This new base class adds the functionality to seamlessly manage schedules
      stored in instances of the :class:`Calibrations` class and implements a
      framework where calibration experiments can specify an :meth:`update`
      method to update the parameters that they are designed to calibrate.

    * This release introduces a full suit of single- qubit characterization
      and calibration experiments summarized below.

      * :class:`Rabi`: This experiment scans the amplitude of a pulse and measures
        the qubit population. This allows us to determine the amplitude that creates,
        for example, an ``X`` gate and/or a ``SX`` gate. The calibration version
        of this experiment is the :class:`RoughXSXAmplitudeCal` which extracts
        the amplitudes needed to implement an ``X`` gate an a ``SX`` gate. This
        type of calibration is a rough amplitude calibration since the resulting
        parameter value is typically not very precises.

      * :class:`FineAmplitude`: This experiment repeats a rotation a variable
        number of times to amplify over- and under-rotations. The resulting
        ping-pong pattern in the qubit population is fit to determine the error in
        the rotation angle. The calibration version of this experiment, i.e.
        :class:`FineAmplitudeCal` will update the amplitude of the pulse according
        to the measurred deviation. These classes have several specializations to
        X and SX gates.

      * :class:`RoughDrag`: This experiment scans the DRAG parameter of a repeated
        sequence of rotation and anti-rotation. If the DRAG parameter does not have
        the correct value phase errors will accumulate and the repeated sequece of
        gates will not return the qubit to the ground state. The calibration
        version of this experiment is :class:`RoughDragCal`.

      * :class:`FineDrag`: This experiment iterates the gate sequence Rp - Rm where
        Rp is a rotation around an axis and Rm is the same rotation but in the
        opposite direction. This sequence amplifies phase errors due to the presence
        of higher excited states. The calibration variant of this experiment is
        :class:`FineDragCal` and will update the DRAG parameter in the instance of the
        :class:`Calibrations` class. These experiments have the following
        specializations for X and SX gate: :class:`FineSXDrag`, :class:`FineXDrag`,
        :class:`FineXDragCal`, and :class:`FineSXDragCal`.

      * :class:`QubitSpectroscopy`: This experiment performs spectroscopy by applying
        a frequency shift to a long pulse. This experiment is typically used to
        identify the resonance frequency of the qubit. Its calibration variant is
        :class:`RoughFrequencyCal` which gives us a first rough estimate of the qubit
        frequency.

      * :class:`RamseyXY`: This experiment performs a Ramsey-XY experiment which
        allows us to measure the frequency of the qubit. This experiment is sensitive
        to the sign of the frequency offset from the main transition. It is a more
        precise measurement than spectroscopy. Its calibration counter part is
        :class:`FrequencyCal`.

      * :class:`FineFrequency`: This experiment performs an error amplyfing sequence
        to measure the frequency of the qubit. This is done with delay instructions
        with a variable length and rz gates. The calibration version of this
        experiment is :class:`FineFrequencyCal`.

      * :class:`HalfAngle`: This experiment measures the amount by which the SX and X
        gates are not parallel. Such errors can occur due to phase errors. For example,
        the non-linearities in the mixer's skew for :math:`\pi/2` pulses may be
        different from the :math:`\pi` pulse. The calibration version of this
        experiment is :class:`HalfAngleCal`.

    * Qiskit-experiment 0.2 allows the serialization of the :class:`BasisGateLibrary`
      class and its sub-classes.

    * The update library has been simplified. Is functionality has been merged into
      the calibration experiments. Future releases may fully deprecate the
      :class:`BaseUpdater` in favour of moving its functionality into the
      :class:`BaseCalibrationExperiment`.

issues:
  - |
    List known issues here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.
upgrade:
  - |
    * The :class:`BackendCalibrations` class has been merged into the
      :class:`Calibrations` class. Users should now use the :class:`Calibrations`
      class which they can instantiate from a backend with the :meth:`from_backend`
      method.
