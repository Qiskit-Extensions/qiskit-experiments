    This change introduces the new experiment
    :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.ResonatorSpectroscopy` to run spectroscopy
    on readout resonators. This is done by attaching a custom pulse-schedule to
    the measure instruction. Furthermore, a new data processing node
    :py:class`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.nodes.ToAbs` is introduced to
    take the absolute value of the IQ points. This node is needed to analyse readout
    resonator spectroscopy IQ data since it rotates around in the IQ plane. Note that
    the resonator spectroscopy experiment may cause errors on backends that do not
    support circuit instructions with measurement schedules attached to them.
