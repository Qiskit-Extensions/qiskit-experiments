    Definiton of the chi-squared value stored in the analysis result has been changed.

    From this version, the definition becomes

    ..math::

      \chi^2 = \sum_{i} \frac{(O_i - C_i)^2}

    which indicates a residual sum of squares (RSS). This definition used to be

    ..math::

      \chi^2 = \sum_{i} \frac{(O_i - C_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}

    where :math:`O_i` and :math:`C_i` are ovserved and calculated values, respectively,
    and the :math:`\sigma_i^2` is a variance of the observed data.
    The :math:`\sigma_i^2` is computed as a sampling error, which is defined by

    ..math::

      \sigma_i^2 = \tilde{p} * (1 - \tilde{p}) / {\rm shots}

    where :math:`\tilde{p}` is the population computed from the counts, i.e.
    :math:`\sum c_i / {\rm shots}`. This sometime increases :math:`\chi^2` as :math:`\tilde{p}`
    approaches to 1. Because many fit quality evaluations use this :math:`\chi^2`,
    conventional definition doesn't provide a good estimate of the fit quality.

    Note that the chi-squared value in the fit result and fit quality evaluation
    are no longer compatibile with one generated by the code with older version.
