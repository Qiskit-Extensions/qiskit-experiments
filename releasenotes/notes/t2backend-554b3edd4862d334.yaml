    The :class:`qiskit_experiments.test.t2hahn_backend.T2HahnBackend` was
    refactored to use the simulator from qiskit-aer which provides better
    performance. As part of the refactoring, support was removed for passing
    qubit parameters (e.g.  ``t2hahn``, ``frequency``,
    ``initialization_error``, etc.) as single element lists when the backend
    has more than one qubit. These arguments need to be passed as numbers that
    apply to all qubits or sequences of numbers with one entry for each qubit.
    If passing numbers for a backend to represent more than one qubit, at least
    one parameter must be passed as a sequence or the ``num_qubits`` parameter
    must be passed to indicate how many qubits the backend should simulate.
