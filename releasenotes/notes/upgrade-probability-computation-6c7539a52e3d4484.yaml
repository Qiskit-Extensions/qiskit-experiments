    Update the :class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.Probability`
    data processing node to compute the estimated mean and standard deviation
    of a measurement outcome probability using a Bayesian update of a
    a Beta distribution prior given the observed measurement outcomes.
    
    The default uninformative prior assumes ignorance about the probability
    to be estimated and will prevent the estimated mean from being exactly
    0 or 1, and prevent the estimated standard deviation from being 0, which
    could cause issues with computing weights during curve fitting. A custom
    prior can also be provided if prior information about the probability is
    know.
