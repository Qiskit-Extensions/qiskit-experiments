    Add ``backend`` as an optional ``__init__`` kwarg for all experiments to
    alow setting the backend at initialization. The backand can also be set
    and retrieved from the experiment object after construction using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseExperiment.backend`
    property and setter.

    When using the ``backend`` kwarg of
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseExperiment.run` to specify
    a backend this will temporarily override any currently set backends
    for that single execution.

    Added a ``_set_backend`` method to
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseExperiment` that is called
    when a backend is set via initalization or the ``backend`` setter. This
    can be overridden in experiment subclasses if required. For example this
    could be used to extract any needed configuration or properties from the
    specified backend, or to update experiment options of configuration based
    on the backend.
