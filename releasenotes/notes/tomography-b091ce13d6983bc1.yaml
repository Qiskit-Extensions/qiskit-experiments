features:
  - |
    Adds ``backend``, ``analysis``, and ``target`` init kwargs to the
    :class:`~.StateTomography` and :class:`~.ProcessTomography` experiments.
    These allow specifying intented backend, a custom analysis class, or a
    custom target for fidelity calculations, when initializing the experiments.
upgrade:
  - |
    Renames the ``qubits``, ``measurement_qubits``, and ``preparation_qubits``
    init kwargs of :class:`~.StateTomography`,
    :class:`~.ProcessTomography`, and :class:`~.TomographyExperiment` to
    ``physical_qubits``, ``measurement_indices`` and ``preparation_indices``
    respectively. This is to make the intended use of these kwargs more clear
    as the measurement and preparation args refer to the index of circuit
    qubits in the physical qubits list, not the physical qubit values
    themselves.
deprecations:
  - |
    Renames the ``qubits``, ``measurement_qubits``, and ``preparation_qubits``
     init kwargs of :class:`~.StateTomography`,
    :class:`~.ProcessTomography`, and :class:`~.TomographyExperiment` have
    been deprecated. They have been replaced with kwargs ``physical_qubits``,
    ``measurement_indices`` and ``preparation_indices`` respectively. The
    renamed kwargs have the same functionality as the deprecated kwargs.
