    For randomized benchmarking, tomography, and quantum volume experiments the
    ``qubits`` parameter must contain the list of physical qubits. The option to specify
    ``qubits`` as an integer, as a shortcut to the range of qubits from 0 to `qubits-1`,
    has been removed. This is true also for the class 
    :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.base_experiment_BaseExperiment`.
