    ``model_description`` is added to
    :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_data.SeriesDef`.
    This field stores the string representation of the fit model of the curve.
    This information is appended to the analysis result and will be
    saved in the result database (if possible).
