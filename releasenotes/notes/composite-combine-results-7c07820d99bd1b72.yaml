    Adds a ``combine_results`` analysis option to :class:`.CompositeAnalysis`
    that if set to ``True`` combines all analysis results and figures from
    component experiment analysis into a single :class:`.ExperimentData`
    container. This can be used to flatten results from :class:`.ParallelExperiment`
    and :class:`.BatchExperiment` into a single :class:`.ExperimentData` container.
    
    If set to ``False`` (the default value) the results of each component
    experiment will be saved as separate :meth:`~.ExperimentData.child_data`
    as was previously done.

    Note that for nested composite experiments setting ``combine_results=True``
    will recursively set the same value for all component experiments that
    are also composite experiments.
