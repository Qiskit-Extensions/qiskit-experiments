    You can now change the default ``matplotlib`` backend used for generated
    figures by setting
    ``qiskit_experiments.framework.matplotlib.default_figure_canvas`` to the
    desired canvas. Note that it has to be a canvas for one of the
    `non-interactive backend
    <https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#the-builtin-backends>`_.
    For example, you can set ``default_figure_canvas`` to
    :class:`~matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg` to use the
    ``AGG`` backend.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default ``matplotlib`` backend used for generated figures was changed
    from `AGG` to `SVG`.
