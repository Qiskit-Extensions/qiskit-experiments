    The class :class:`~MockIQBackend` for testing has been updated to support
    multiple qubits. It now takes lists of IQ cluster centers and widths as input,
    and specific backends are now defined as subclasses of
    :class:`.MockIQExperimentHelper`.

    Adds two new classes, :class:`.MockIQParallelExperimentHelper` and :class:`.MockIQParallelBackend`
    for running parallel experiments on the mock IQ backend.
