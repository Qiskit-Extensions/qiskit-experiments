    ``model_description`` is added to :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.\
    curve_data.SeriesDef`. This field stores the string representation of
    the fit model of the curve. This information is appended to the analysis
    result and will be saved in the result database (if possible).

    Developer of the curve analysis subclass can use this field to bind information of
    fit model to the fit result entry as a part of the extra information.
