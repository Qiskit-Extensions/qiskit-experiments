    Qiskit Experiments 0.6 introduces numerous features and improvements. It is compatible with Qiskit 1.0.
    Notable changes include refactoring the analysis results to a Pandas dataframe, and refactoring
    curve fit data into a new :class:`.ScatterTable` container based on dataframes that is stored
    by default as an artifact in :class:`.ExperimentData` along with the summary of fit results.
    New experiments include :class:`.StarkP1Spectroscopy`, :class:`.StarkRamseyXY`, and
    :class:`.StarkRamseyXYAmpScan`. The supported provider for running jobs on IBM backends is 
    now ``qiskit-ibm-runtime``. Using ``qiskit-ibm-provider`` is still supported but its use is deprecated.
