upgrade:
  - |
    The :class:`CurveAnalysis` class has been updated to use the covariance between fit
    parameters in the error propagation. This will provide more accurate standard
    error for your fit values.
  - |
    The data format of analysis result data value has been replaced from
    :class:`FitVal` from :class:`UFloat` to support error propatation for
    post analysis computation.

    .. code-block:: python

      expdata = T1(0, delays, backend).run()
      fit_t1 = expdata.analysis_results("T1").value

      assert isinstance(fit_t1, UFloat)

      new_value = fit_t1 / 2
      new_value.std_dev  # show new standard error value

    Now ``fit_t1`` value is :class:`UFloat` instance with properties :attr:`.nominal_value`
    and :attr:`.std_dev`, and you can directly apply methematical operation to this value.
  - |
    The curve fit plot generated by the :class:`CurveAnalysis` shows a
    confidence interval properly computed with error propagation.
    By default it shows 1 sigma and 3 sigma region but you can customize this
    via the ``style`` option of the curve analysis subclass.
