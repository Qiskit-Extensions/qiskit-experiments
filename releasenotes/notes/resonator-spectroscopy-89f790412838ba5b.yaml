    This change introduces a new experiment that allows users to run spectroscopy
    on readout resonators. This is done by attaching a custom pulse-schedule to
    the measure instruction. Furthermore, a new data processing node is introduced
    that takes the absolute value of the IQ points. This node is needed to analyse
    readout resonator spectroscopy IQ data since it rotates around in the IQ plane.
