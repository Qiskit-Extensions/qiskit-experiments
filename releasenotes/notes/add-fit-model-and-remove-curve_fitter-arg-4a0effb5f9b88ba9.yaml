features:
  - |
    :attr:`CurveAnalysis.fit_model` and :attr:`CurveAnalysis.parameters` have been
    added to the curve analysis and its subclasses. These properties return
    :class:`FitModel` instance that represents a fit function of the analysis
    and parameters to be fit with the analysis, respectively.
  - |
    New classes :class:`SingleFitFunction` and :class:`CompositeFitFunction` have been
    added to the curve analysis module. These fit function instance is created for
    each curve analysis subclass, and user can access it via
    the curve analysis property ``.fit_model``.
    Note that the fit function instance can be called by itself, and user can manually test
    the curve beeing computed against given x values and parameters.
    In addition, these function implements pretty printing to describe the function itself.
    These information have been hidden in the private member :attr:`CurveAnalysis.__series__`,
    but now one can easily grasp the fit model details with these fit function object.
upgrade:
  - |
    Analysis option `curve_fitter` of the :class:`CurveAnalysis` has been removed
    because of the serialization problem. To use custom curve fitting library,
    one must directly override the class method :meth:`CurveAnalysis.curve_fit`.
developer:
  - |
    :meth:`CurveAnalysis.curve_fit` has been added to the curve analysis and
    its subclasses. Now you can directly access the core fitting code
    with bare numpy arrays representing data to be fit.
    This may help debugging of new fit functions.
