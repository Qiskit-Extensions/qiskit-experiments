    Curve analysis may have imperfection in the uncertainty propagation computation.
    Fit paramters consist of the nominal part and standard error, however,
    the correlation of these paramters are not precisely taken into account.
    This sometimes result in the overestimation of the confidence interval of fit curves,
    or overestimation of the standard error of some analysis values computed with
    multiple fitting parameters. This issue will be solved in the version 0.3.
    See qiskit-experiments/#551 for details.
