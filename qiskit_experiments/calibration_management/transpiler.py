    """This BaseCalibrationAdder stores schedules in the calibrations.

    This transpiler pass is intended to be run in the :meth:`circuits` method of the
    experiment classes before the main transpiler pass. It's only goal is to extract
    the needed pulse schedules from an instance of Calibrations and attach them to the
    template circuit. This has a couple of challenges.

    * First, the same pulse in the calibrations can be attached to different gates.
      For example, an X-gate "x" may need to be attached to a Rabi gate in a
      :class:`Rabi` experiment while in an :class:`EFSpectroscopy` experiment it will
      be attached to the X-gate.

    * Second, the gate may sometimes be attached with parameters and sometimes not.
      In a Rabi experiment the "x" schedule will have a parametric amplitude while in
      the :class:`FineXAmplitude` the gate will not have any free parameters.

    These two issues are solved by adding an InstructionMap which is a named tuple of
    instruction name in the circuit, the schedule name in the calibrations and any
    parameter instance that needs to be unassigned when getting the schedule from the
    :class:`Calibrations` instance. Consider the following examples.

    .. code-block::python

        # Instruction mapping for a Rabi experiment
        InstructionMap("Rabi", "x", [Parameter("amp")])

        # Instruction mapping for a Drag experiment
        beta = Parameter("Î²")
        InstructionMap("Rp", "x", [beta])
        InstructionMap("Rm", "xm", [beta])

    Note that if no mapping is provided this transpiler pass assumes that the name of
    the schedule in the calibrations is the same as the name of the gate instruction.
