Experiment Manuals
==================

These experiment manuals are in-depth dives into individual experiments, their
operational principles, and how to run them in Qiskit Experiments.

.. _benchmarking:

Benchmarking Experiments
------------------------

These experiments measure your device performance according to a set of defined
metrics, such as the space-time volume of circuits that can be successfully executed.

Qubit Characterization Experiments
----------------------------------

These experiment measure specific properties of a qubit.

.. _measurement-related:

Measurement-Related Experiments
-------------------------------

These experiments postprocess on measurement results to improve some aspect of a
quantum circuit, such as readout fidelity or run time.
