This file contains the Clifford group represented as integers.
In CLIFF_COMPOSE_DATA, (i, j): k represents Clifford(i).compose(clifford(j)) = Clifford(k).
Since retrieving a value from an array is more efficient than from a dict, therefore
we store only the results (k) in the array CLIFF_COMPOSE_DATA.
The index is computed in CliffordUtils.compose_num_with_clifford().
Note that for the pairs (i, j), i can be any clifford, and j represents only the
1-gate Cliffords, as listed in CliffordUtils.general_cliff_list
