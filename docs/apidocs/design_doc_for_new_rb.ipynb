    "## Main ideas:\n",
    "There are three main ideas in the new algorithm:\n",
    "1.\tFor every Clifford, store its transpiled circuit. This way we can build the RB circuit out of transpiled Cliffords. In this way, we avoid transpilation of the entire circuit, which is the bottleneck in terms of performance for the current algorithm. We call this transpiled Cliffords.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tCreate a 1-1 mapping between Cliffords and integers. This enables group operations such as compose and inverse to be performed on the equivalent group of integers, rather than on the Clifford group. The computations for compose and inverse on integers are stored in advance. We call this Clifford data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tFor the compose operation (◦), the full table of all compose results is very large: $11520 \\times 11520 = 132,710,400$. \n",
    "We notice that for $A ◦ B$, we can replace it by $A ◦ B_0 ◦ B_1 ◦.… ◦B_k$, where $B = B_0 ◦ B_1 ◦.… ◦B_k$ and $B_i$ are Cliffords consisting of a single gate, $0 ≤ i ≤ k$. Therefore, it is sufficient to store only the results of all $A ◦ G$, where $G$ represents the single gate Cliffords. We identified 20 single-gate Cliffords, thus reducing the number of compose results to $11520 X 20 = 230,400$.\n"

    "2.\tGenerate the transpiled Cliffords by invoking the file `generate_transpiled_circuits.py`. The data is stored in a file named `transpiled_circs_<suffix>.qpy`, where suffix indicates the number of qubits and the basis gates for which we transpiled. There are currently two such files that can be used as defaults: `transpiled_circs_2q_rz_sx_cx.qpy` and `transpiled_circs_2q_x_h_s_cx.qpy` and similar files for 1 qubit. \n",

    "We add two new fields: transpiled_cliff_circuits[1] and transpiled_cliff_circuits[2]\n",
    "These are initialized in __init__() to None. Later, in circuits() the transpiled circuits are loaded from the file into one of these.\n",
    "Note that here, as well as in other places, we limit the number of qubits to 1 or 2. This is intentional, as the algorithm will not work for more than 2 qubits.\n",
    "The question is how to deal with more than 2 qubits.\n",
    "I can think of two ways to resolve this – keep the old code alongside the new code using `if n > 2` statements. Or separate this into 2 different experiments – one for 1-2  qubits and the other for more. **Any suggestions?**\n",
