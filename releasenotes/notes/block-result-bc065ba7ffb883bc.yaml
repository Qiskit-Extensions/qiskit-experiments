features:
  - |
    Added a ``block`` kwarg with default value ``block=True`` to the
    :meth:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    method. If this is True then calling
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    will block to wait for all running analysis callbacks to finish before
    returning results. This prevents issues where trying to retrieve analysis
    results before analysis was finished would raise an error that the result
    could not be found.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :meth:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    method has been changed to block on analysis callbacks finishing by
    default, this means it is no longer necessary to call the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.block_for_results`
    method first before accessing analysis results.
    
    To disable blocking this can be set to run with ``block=False``.
    This should be used
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    needs to be called during another analysis callback to prevent that
    callback from blocking.
