    Default fit bounds for ``d_theta`` parameter of
    :py:class:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.ErrorAmplificationAnalysis`
    class has been updated from [-pi, pi] to [-0.8 pi, 0.8 pi]. This change will improve
    the bad fit when the error value is really close to zero.
    This has sometimes yielded in ``d_theta`` ~ pi rather than zero.
