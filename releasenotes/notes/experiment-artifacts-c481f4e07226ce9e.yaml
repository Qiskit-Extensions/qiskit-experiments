features:
  - |
    An artifact class has been introduced to store long-form data generated by experiments.
    The :class:`.CurveFitResult` and :class:`.ScatterTable` generated by experiments 
    are now stored in artifacts in the :class:`.ExperimentData` class. :meth:`.add_artifacts`
    and :meth:`.delete_artifact` have been added to manipulate the artifacts. These will be uploaded
    to the cloud service in JSON form along with the rest of the :class:`.ExperimentData` object
    when saved. For more information, see the :doc:`artifacts how-to </howtos/artifacts>`.
upgrade:
  - |
    Direct access to the curve fit summary in :class:`.ExperimentData` has moved from
    :meth:`.analysis_results` to :meth:`.artifacts`, where values are stored in the
    :attr:`~.ArtifactData.data` attribute of :class:`.ArtifactData` objects. For example, to access the
    chi-squared of the fit, ``expdata.analysis_results(0).chisq`` is now
    ``expdata.artifacts("fit_summary").data.chisq``. Note that this may also shift the indices of
    analysis results that are not curve fit results. For more information, see the :doc:`artifacts how-to
    </howtos/artifacts>`.
deprecations:
  - |
    Setting the option ``return_data_points`` to ``True`` in curve analysis has been deprecated.
    Data points are now automatically provided in :class:`ExperimentData` objects via the ``curve_data``
    artifact.
