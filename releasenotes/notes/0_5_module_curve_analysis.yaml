features:
  - |
    Several new features of initial guess algorithms for the curve fitting have been introduced.
    
    * The one-stop initial guess algorithm for sinusoidal signal has been introduced as
      :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.composite_sinusoidal_estimate`.
      This algorithm assumes a model characterized by the fit parameters (amp, freq, base, phase),
      and internally assembles the best fitting algorithm depending on which 
      parameters are pre-determined. This function returns an iterator of multiple fit parameters.
    * :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.frequency_lorentz_fit` has been introduced. 
      This is a drop-in replacement of :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.frequency`.
      New function fine tunes the frequency estimate by Lorentzian fitting around the main FFT peak.
    * :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.low_frequency_limit` has been introduced.
      This function is dedicated to the frequency estimate at the lower frequency limit.
      Usually this function gives better frequency estimate around zero frequency.
    * :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.sinusoidal_freq_offset` has been introduced.
      This algorithm uses two delayed data set to simulataneously estimate frequency and offset
      of a sinusoidal signal. Because this function doesn't use FFT, it is more robust to
      the error of base offset estimation error.
    * :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.exp_decay` has been upgraded to 
      new algorithm that allows analysis of a damped oscillation signal with finite base offset.

deprecations:
  - |
    Several initial guess functions are merged and deprecated.
    
    * :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.frequency` has been deprecated and
      replaced with :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.frequency_lorentz_fit`.
    * :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.oscillation_exp_decay` has been deprecated
      and merged into :func:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.guess.exp_decay`.
