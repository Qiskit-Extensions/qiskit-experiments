    A :class:`.BaseCalibrations` class has been introduced as an abstract base class
    of Qiskit Experiments calibrations. All calibration subclasses must inherit from
    the abstract base class and implement all defined methods.
    
    All calibration experiment classes can safely rely on the defined methods, 
    but other custom methods in a particular subclass are not necessary implemented,
    and such dependency may cause attribute error in execution.
