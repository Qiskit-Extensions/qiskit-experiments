features:
  - |
    Added support for JSON serialization to
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BasisGateLibrary`.
  - |
    Simplified the update library for calibration experiments by merging
    this functionality into the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment`.
    
    Future releases may fully deprecate the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.update_library.BaseUpdater`
    in favour of moving its functionality into the
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``BackendCalibrations`` class has bas been removed and its functionality
    has been merged into the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations` class. Users
    should now use the :class:`Calibrations`
    class which can be instantiated from a backend by using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations.from_backend`
    method.
developer:
  - |
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration` experiments have been changed
    so that each experiment is a subclass of a
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization` experiment.
    
    Calibration experiments should now be constructed as subclasses of both
    the relevant characterization experiment and the new
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment`
    abstract base class.
  
    This new base class implements the functionality to manage schedules
    stored in instances of the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations` class and
    implements a framework where calibration experiments can specify an
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment.update`
    method to update the parameters that they are designed to calibrate.
