features:
  - |
    Added
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.database_service.DbExperimentData.add_analysis_callback`
    method to :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData`
    for adding a post-processing analysis function to run as a callback after
    currently executing experiment jobs are finished.
  - |
    Added a ``block`` kwarg with default value ``block=True`` to the
    :meth:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    method. If this is True then calling
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    will block to wait for all running analysis callbacks to finish before
    returning results. This prevents issues where trying to retrieve analysis
    results before analysis was finished would raise an error that the result
    could not be found.

    Note that in the case of
    :class:`~qiskit-experiments.framework.ParallelExperiment` and
    :class:`~qiskit-experiments.framework.BatchExperiment` blocking or
    calling ``analysis_results`` on the parent experiment should be performed
    before attempting to access results in the component experiment data
    containers to ensure the component analysis callbacks
    have been initialized.
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` class
    can now store child ``ExperimentData`` containers.
    Child data can either be added at initialization using the
    ``child_data`` kwarg or added later using the 
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.add_child_data`
    method. Child ``ExperimentData`` can be accessed using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.child_data`
    method.
  - |
    Added a :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.copy`
    method to :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` which
    allows making a copy of an experiment data container with a new
    experiment ID, new result IDs, and new figure names, generated for
    the copy.
    
    This method has a kwarg option ``copy_results`` that can be set to
    ``False`` to only copy the experiment
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.data` and
    metadata, but not the analysis results and figures.
  - |
    Added methods
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.add_tags_recursive` and
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.remove_tags_recursive`
    to :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` for adding and
    removing tags of an experiment data object and all its
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.child_data`.
  - |
    Added support for saving and loading
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ParallelExperiment`
    and :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.BatchExperiment` experiment data
    and all component experiment data and results from the IBM experiments
    database service. Changing the share level of the parent composite
    experiment will also change the share level of all component experiments.

    When saving composite experiments each component experiment analysis
    results and figures will be saved under a unique experiment ID. Note that
    these component experiments do not save any of the marginalized circuit
    result data. The unmarginalized circuit result data is saved in the parent
    componsite experiments.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``CompositeExperimentData`` class has been removed and its
    functionality integrated into the
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` class.
    A composite :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData`
    can now be created by initializing with a list of child
    ``ExperimentData`` containers using the ``child_data`` kwarg.
  - |
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ParallelExperiment` and
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BatchExperiment` now return
    a :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` object
    which no longer contains a ``component_experiment_data`` method.
    This method has been replaced by the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.child_data`
    method.
  - |
    The :meth:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    method has been changed to block on analysis callbacks finishing by
    default, this means it is no longer necessary to call the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.block_for_results`
    method first before accessing analysis results.
    
    To disable blocking this can be set to run with ``block=False``.
    This should be used
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    needs to be called during another analysis callback to prevent that
    callback from blocking.
  - |
    The ``callback`` and ``**kwarg`` arguments have been removed from
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framwork.ExperimentData.add_data`
    To add a callback function to run after experiment jobs have finished
    executing use the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.add_analysis_callback`
    method instead.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug where the 
    :meth:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.load` method 
    would return an
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.database_service.DbExperimentDataV1` object
    instead of a :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` object.
  - |
    Fixed bug in :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` where
    trying to load saved job data from a backend using
    ``ExperimentData(backend=backend, job_ids=job_ids)`` resulted in an error.
