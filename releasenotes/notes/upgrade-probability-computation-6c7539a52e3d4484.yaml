    Compuation of probability from count data has been updated.
    Previously, the probability is computed with the count of the outcome and shot number,
    and the variance is computed by assuming a binominal distribution.
    However, this has been sometime resulting in a zero variance,
    which may induce a zero division error during the following fitting.
    With this update, :py:class:`qiskit_experiments.data_processing.nodes.Probability` node
    returns the most likely value of probability and standard error assuming the
    Dirichlet distribution with given flat prior, by computing the poterior with Bayes update.
    See class documentation of the node for details.
    This change may impact your experiment analysis results especially when the shot number
    is really small, e.g. ~ 100.
