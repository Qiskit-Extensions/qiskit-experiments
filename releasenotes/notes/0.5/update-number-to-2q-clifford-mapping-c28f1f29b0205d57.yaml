deprecations:
  - |
    Two helper methods :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_cliffords` and
    :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_clifford_circuits` have been deprecated. Their functionality
    are now incorporated into :meth:`.StandardRB.__sample_sequence`.
other:
  - |
    :meth:`.CliffordUtils.clifford_2_qubit` (and :meth:`.CliffordUtils.clifford_2_qubit_circuit`)
    changed its mapping between integers and 2Q Cliffords.
    As a consequence, circuits sampled by 2Q RB experiments may have been changed,
    even if exactly the same arguments are used for their construction.
  - |
    Removed unnecessary ``Barrier`` instructions in front of circuits generated by
    :class:`.StandardRB` and :class:`.InterleavedRB`.
