    An analysis option ``reps`` in :class:`.DragCalAnalysis` was dropped. Now analysis
    is bootstrapped with circuit metadata and setting this value no longer impacts the
    analysis result. This upgrade doesn't introduce any breaking API change for existing
    experiments.

    Fixed a bug where redoing :meth:`.DragCalAnalysis.run` generated wrong fit models.
