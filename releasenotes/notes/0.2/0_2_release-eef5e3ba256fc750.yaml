    The Qiskit Experiments 2.0 release includes several bug fixes and
    improvements and many new experiments added to the
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library`. Added experiments include a full suite
    of single-qubit gate calibration and characterization experiments, and
    two-qubit Cross-resonance Hamiltonian characterization experiments.

    There are also numerous changes and improvements to the base classes in
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.framework` and
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management` to make
    developing new experiments easier, to improve JSON serialization, and to 
    improve storing and loading experiments for the IBM experiment database
    service.
features:

    You can now change the default ``matplotlib`` backend used for generated
    figures by setting
    ``qiskit_experiments.framework.matplotlib.default_figure_canvas`` to the
    desired canvas. Note that it has to be a canvas for one of the
    `non-interactive backend
    <https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#the-builtin-backends>`_.
    For example, you can set ``default_figure_canvas`` to
    :class:`~matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg` to use the
    ``AGG`` backend.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default ``matplotlib`` backend used for generated figures was changed
    from `AGG` to `SVG`.

    Adds hooks for serialization and deserialization of custom classes to
    the JSON :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentEncoder`
    and :class:`qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentDecoder`.
    To enable serialization classes must implement a method
    ``__json_encode__(self) -> Any`` that returns a JSON serializable object,
    and a class method ``_json_decode__(cls, value: Any)__ -> cls`` that can
    reconstruct the object from the JSON deserialized value.
