features:
  - |
    A helper funciton :func:`lookup_epg_ratio` has been added. 
    This function returns predefined error ratio of given gate name for RB experiments.
  - |
    New function :func:`exclude_1q_error` has been added.
    This function makes correction for single qubit channel depolarization for 2Q RB EPC.
upgrade:
  - |
    Implicit computation of gate error ratio in the standard RB experiment will be
    dropped from the experiment code. This information has been used to compute 
    error per gates (EPGs) from the estimated error per Clifford (EPC).
    Now this should be explicitly provided as an experiment option ``gate_error_ratio``.
    By default it computs the error ratio of basis gates with the predefined 
    look-up table. User can set ``False`` to this option to avoid computation of EPGs
    for speed-up. See qiskit-experiments/#762 for more details.
  - |
    :class:`RBAnalysis` has been upgraded to compute corrected EPC for 2Q RB.
    When the analysis option ``qpg_1_qubit`` is provided,
    it internally calls :func:`exclude_1q_error` to exclude contribution of
    single qubit channel depolarization and returns a pure EPC for 2Q channel.
    This result is added to analysis results as ``EPC_corrected``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Calling :meth:`RBUtils.get_error_dict_from_backend` has been deprecated and 
    will be removed after 0.4. This method computes the ratio of basis gate errors 
    from the fresh backend calibration, but error ratio could depend on the
    status of previous calibration. Due to this potential instability, 
    we eliminate the usage of this method.
  - |
    Calling :meth:`RBUtils.gates_per_clifford` has been deprecated and will be
    removed after 0.4. This method compute average gate counts per Clifford
    constituting RB sequence from count ops in the RB circuit metadata.
    This protocol is merged into `StandardRB._transpiled_circuits` for efficiency.
  - |
    Calling :meth:`RBUtils.calculate_1q_epg` and :meth:`RBUtils.calculate_2q_epg`
    have been deprecated and replaced with :func:`calculate_epg`.
