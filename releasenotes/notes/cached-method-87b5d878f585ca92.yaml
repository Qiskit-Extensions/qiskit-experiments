    Adds caching of transpiled circuit generation to :class:`.BaseExperiment`
    so that repeated calls of :class:`~.BaseExperiment.run` will avoid
    repeated circuit generation and transpilation costs if no experiment options
    are changed between run calls.

    Changing experiment or transpilation options with the
    :meth:`~.BaseExperiment.set_experiment_options` or
    :meth:`~.BaseExperiment.set_transpilation_options` will clear the
    cached circuits. The cache can also be manually cleared by calling the
    :meth:`~.BaseExperiment.cache_clear` method.
