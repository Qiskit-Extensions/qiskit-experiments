    Compuation of probability from count data has been updated.
    Previously, the probability is computed with the count of the outcome and shot number,
    and the variance is computed by assuming a binominal distribution.
    However, this has been sometime resulting in a zero variance,
    which may induce a zero division error during the following fitting.
    To avoid this, a new data processor node :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.\
    nodes.DirichletProbability` is added, in which the probability is computed from the mode,
    and the variance is computed by assuming a Dirichlet distribution with a flat prior.
    See class documentation of the node for details.
    The default :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.data_processor.DataProcessor`
    configuration is replaced with :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.nodes.\
    DirichletProbability` but the conventional :py:class:`qiskit_experiments.data_processing.\
    nodes.Probability` node will be continuously supported.
    This change may impact your experiment data especially when the shot number
    is really small, e.g. ~ 100.
