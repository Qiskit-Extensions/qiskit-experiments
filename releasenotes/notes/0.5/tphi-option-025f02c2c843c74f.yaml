    The :class:`.Tphi` has been changed to use :class:`.T2Hahn` as the default T2 
    estimate because it provides a more meaningful measurement on superconducting
    devices. An option ``t2type`` has been added to allow the user to toggle between
    using :math:`T_2^*` from :class:`.T2Ramsey` by specifying "ramsey" or :math:`T_2` 
    from :class:`.T2Hahn`, which is the default value "hahn".
