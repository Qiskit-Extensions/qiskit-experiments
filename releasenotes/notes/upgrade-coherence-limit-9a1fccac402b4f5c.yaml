    A function computing the coherence limit error is renamed to
    :meth:`.RBUtils.coherence_limit_error` and upgraded so that it can compute
    the error of gates with three or more qubits. Note that the order of arguments
    is slightly changed from the original function :meth:`.RBUtils.coherence_limit`,
    which is now deprecated.
