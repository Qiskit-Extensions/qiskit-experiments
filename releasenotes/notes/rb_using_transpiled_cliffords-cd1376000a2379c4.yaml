   Implemented a new algorithm for rb_experiment. This algorithm builds Cliffords out of
   three layers. The Cliffords in each layer are transpiled in advance.
   To create a cClifford, a circuit is selected for each layer, and the
   three circuits are composed.
   In addition, compose and inverse operations are 
   computed using a mapping between Cliffords and integers, making these 
   operations much faster. The mapping is stored in the file 'clifford_data.py.
