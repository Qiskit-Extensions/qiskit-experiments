upgrade:
  - |
    The ``CompositeExperimentData`` class has been removed and its
    functionality integrated into the
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` class.
    A composite :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData`
    can now be created by initializing with a list of child
    ``ExperimentData`` containers using the ``child_data`` kwarg.
  - |
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ParallelExperiment` and
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BatchExperiment` now return
    a :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` object
    which no longer contains a ``composite_experiment_data`` method.
    This method has been replaced by the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.child_data`
    method.
features:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData` class
    can now store child ``ExperimentData`` containers.
    Child data can either be added at initialization using the
    ``child_data`` kwarg or added later using the 
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.add_child_data`
    method. Child ``ExperimentData`` can be accessed using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.child_data`
    method.
