    The handling of user provided initial guesses and fit boundaries in the
    :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis` has been changed.
    A curve analysis subclass doesn't need to worry about user provided options, since
    the logic is updated so that propagation of user values in the computation is
    implicitly managed by :py:class:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_data.OptionsDict`.

    Note that the method name to provide these initial guesses is also updated from
    ``_setup_fitting`` to ``_generate_fit_guesses`` to reflect the new behavior of the method.
    Please update your curve analysis subclasses to conform to the new method name,
    otherwise the method will be never called.
    You can also remove the conventional code to manage user guesses and bounds from the method.
    See the documentation of :meth:`_generate_fit_guesses` for more details.
