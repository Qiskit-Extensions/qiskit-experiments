    Several deprecated methods and options have been removed and will no longer work:

    * Passing the ``qubits`` keyword argument or an integer qubit index to experiments is no longer
    allowed. Use ``physical_qubits`` keyword argument with a sequence type input.
    * The ``scipy_linear_lstsq`` and ``scipy_gaussian_lstsq`` fitters for the
    :class:`.StateTomographyAnalysis` and :class:`.ProcessTomographyAnalysis`
    classes have been removed. Use the :func:`.linear_lstsq`, :func:`.cvxpy_linear_lstsq`,
    or :func:`.cvxpy_gaussian_lstsq` fitters instead.
