    Default data pre-processing for fit data is added to the :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.\
    curve_analysis.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis`. The input data to the analysis are
    averaged over the same x values and sorted by x values. This processing is necessary to
    correctly analyze an experimental data which has multiple same x values, e.g. run experiment
    with the previous experimental data.
