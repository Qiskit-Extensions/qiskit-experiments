    Curve analysis is updated to use the covariance between fit parameters in the error propagation.
    Now, all result figures show a 1 sigma and 3 sigma confidence intervals with
    semitransparent filled-area with different transparency around the bold fit line.
    The width of the area corresponds to the standard deviation computed by the
    uncertainties of fit parameters with the covariance matrix. All analysis outcomes derived from the 
    fit parameters also have a standard error computed in the same way.
