    Adds readout error mitigated tomography experiments
    :class:`.MitigatedStateTomography` and :class:`.MitigatedProcessTomography`.
    These are both implemented as a :class:``.BatchExperiment` consisting of a
    :class:`~.LocalReadoutError` characterization experiment followed by either
    a :class:`~.StateTomography` or class:`~.ProcessTomography` experiment.
