features:
  - |
    Added a new experiment option for batch experiments called ``separate_jobs``. If set
    to ``True``, then circuits of different sub-experiments will be routed to different
    jobs. Default value is ``False``.
  - |
    Added a ``max_circuits`` experiment option to :class:`~.BaseExperiment` to allow
    specifying the max number of circuits per job when running an experiment.
    If set to ``None`` (default), the max circuits per job is determined by the
    backend. If both the option value and backend value are not ``None``, the
    miniminum of the two values will be used for job splitting.
