    Several deprecated methods and options have been removed and will no longer work:
    
    * The ``component_experiment_data()`` method has been removed from 
      :class:`.ExperimentData` and replaced by :meth:`.ExperimentData.child_data`.
    * The ``CompositeExperiment.component_analysis`` method has been removed. Component 
      analysis classes should be directly accessed using 
      :meth:`.CompositeAnalysis.component_analysis`.
    * The ``library`` argument to :class:`Calibrations` has been removed and replaced by 
      ``libraries``.
    * The class attribute ``CurveAnalysis.__fixed_parameters__`` has been removed.
      The ``fixed_parameters`` analysis option should be set instead.
    * The method ``CurveAnalysis._data()`` has been removed.
    * The :class:`.CurveAnalysis` attribute ``__series__`` has been removed and is 
      replaced by the constructor argument.
    * The ``FineDragAnalysis``, ``FineFrequencyAnalysis``, and ``FineHalfAngleAnalysis``
      analysis classes have been removed and replaced by 
      :class:`.ErrorAmplificationAnalysis`.
    * The ``RBUtils`` class, consisting of utility functions for randomized benchmarking
      experiments, has been removed. Helper methods used in RB experiments have been 
      incorporated into the analysis class.
    * The ``error_dict`` analysis option of :class:`.RBAnalysis` has been removed and 
      merged into the analysis option ``gate_error_ratio``.
