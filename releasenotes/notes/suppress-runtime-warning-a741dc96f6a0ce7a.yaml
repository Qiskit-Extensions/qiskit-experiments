    NumPy runtime warning for zero division is suppressed in :class:`.CurveAnalysis`.
    This warning could occur in the edge case where the experiment data
    may contain data point with zero uncertainty.
    Such data point is safely ignored by LMFIT, since it may apply infinite fit weight.
    This runtime warning suppression makes standard output cleaner.
