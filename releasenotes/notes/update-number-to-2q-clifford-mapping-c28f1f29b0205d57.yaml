    :meth:`.ClifforUtils.clifford_2_qubit` (and :meth:`.ClifforUtils.clifford_2_qubit_circuit`)
    changes its mapping between integer and 2Q Clifford (circuit).
    That means 2Q RB experiments may sample different set of circuits from before
    even if exactly the same arguments are used for their construction.
