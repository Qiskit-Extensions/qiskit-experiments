features:
  - |
    Adds conditional fragment tomography support to the
    :class:`.StateTomography` and :class:`.ProcessTomography` experiments.
    This allows either conditioning on classical bit values in the tomography
    circuit, and/or conditioning on a subset of the tomography measurements,
    and returning a list of the fitted fragment components for each conditional
    value of the conditioning bits.
  - |
    Adds conditional component fitting support to the fitter functions for
    tomography experiments.
