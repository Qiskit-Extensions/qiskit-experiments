    Tick labels and fit parameters shown in the fit result plot generated by
    :py:class`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis` subclasses
    are nicely formatted with unit with prefactor scalings.
    For example, 1e7 might be now displayed as 10 MHz.

    To enable this change, all third party experiment classes based on
    :py:class`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis`
    need to set new analysis options `xval_unit` and `yval_unit`.
    These options are likely set by the class itself rather than end-users,
    and the fit plots are immediately updated once these options are provided.
