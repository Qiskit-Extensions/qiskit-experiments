    A DataProcessor defines a sequence of operations to perform on experimental data.
    Calling an instance of DataProcessor applies this sequence on the input argument.
    A DataProcessor is created with a list of DataAction instances. Each DataAction
    applies its _process method on the data and returns the processed data. The nodes
    in the DataProcessor may also perform data validation and some minor formatting.
    The output of one data action serves as input for the next data action.
    DataProcessor.__call__(datum) usually takes in an entry from the data property of
    an ExperimentData object (i.e. a dict containing metadata and memory keys and
    possibly counts, like the Result.data property) and produces the formatted data.
    DataProcessor.__call__(datum) extracts the data from the given datum under
    DataProcessor._input_key (which is specified at initialization) of the given datum.
