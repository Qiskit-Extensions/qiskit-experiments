    `ExperimentData.save()` now supports multithreading to improve saving times.
    `save` has two new optional parameters: `max_workers` to denote the maximum
    number of threads used for saving (defaults to the `futures` default) and
    `blocking` do denote whether `save()` blocks (waits for all threads to finish)
    or not.
