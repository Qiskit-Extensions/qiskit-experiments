features:
  - |
    Added a new experiment class :class:`.MirrorRB`. This class implements
    mirror randomized benchmarking, a variant of randomized benchmarking that measures
    the fidelity of user-defined ensembles of randomized mirror circuits.
  - |
    Added a base class that samples circuit layers for randomized benchmarking experiments,
    :class:`.BaseSampler`. The edge grab sampler :class:`.EdgeGrabSampler` and a single
    qubit gate sampler :class:`.SingleQubitSampler` are implemented.
