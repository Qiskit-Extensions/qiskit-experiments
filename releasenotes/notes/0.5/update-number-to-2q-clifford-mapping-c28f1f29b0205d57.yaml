deprecations:
  - |
    Two helper methods :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_cliffords` and
    :meth:`.CliffordUtils.random_clifford_circuits` have been deprecated. Their functionality
    are now incorporated into :meth:`.StandardRB.__sample_sequence`.
other:
  - |
    :meth:`.CliffordUtils.clifford_2_qubit` (and :meth:`.CliffordUtils.clifford_2_qubit_circuit`)
    changed its mapping between integers and 2Q Cliffords.
    That means 2Q RB experiments may sample different set of circuits from before
    even if exactly the same arguments are used for their construction.
  - |
    Removed unnecessary ``Barrier`` instructions in front of circuits generated by
    :class:`.StandardRB` and :class:`.InterleavedRB`.
