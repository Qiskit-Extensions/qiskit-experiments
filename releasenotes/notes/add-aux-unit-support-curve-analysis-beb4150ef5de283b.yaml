    Tick labels and fit parameters shown in the fit result plot generated by
    :py:class`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis` subclasses
    are nicely formatted with unit with prefactor scalings.
    For example, 1e7 might be now displayed as 10 MHz.

    To enable this change, `xval_unit` and `yval_unit` are added to the analysis options of
    :py:class`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis`.
    These options are likely set by the class itself rather than end-users,
    and implicitly update the fit plots.
