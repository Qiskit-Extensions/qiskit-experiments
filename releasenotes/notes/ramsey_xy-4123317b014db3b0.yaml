    The algorithm to estimate fit parameter guesses in :class:`.RamseyXYAnalysis`
    has been upgraded. 
    The previous algorithm was not robust to experiment outcome with low frequency,
    where Ramsey X and Y curves almost stay at P=1.0 and 0.5, respectively.
    The new algorithm also offers reliable initial guesses for such situations.
    In addition, the number of frequency guesses has been increased to cover the uncertainty of FFT.
