    An :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.visualization.BasePlotter.hline` method was
    added to :class:`~qiskit_experiments.visualization.BasePlotter` for
    generating horizontal lines. See `#1348
    <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/pull/1348>`__.

    The
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.quantum_volume.QuantumVolumeAnalysis`
    analysis class was updated to use
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.quantum_volume.QuantumVolumePlotter`
    for its figure generation. The appearance of the figure should be the same
    as in previous
    releases, but now it is easier to customize the figure by setting options
    on the plotter object. See `#1348
    <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments/pull/1348>`__.
