features:
  - |
    Added a ``backend`` init kwarg to the :class:`.LocalReadoutError` and
    :class:`.CorrelatedReadoutError` experiments, and the
    ``physical_qubits`` kwarg has been made optional. If a backend is supplied without
    specifying phyiscal qubits, the experiment will be initialized on all
    qubits for the backend.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed bug in the :class:`~.LocalReadoutError` experiment where analysis
    would fail when run on an ideal simulator with no readout error.

    See `Issue #992 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments/issues/992>`_
    for additional details.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``qubits`` kwarg of the following experiments has been deprecated and
    renamed to ``physical_qubits``: :class:`.LocalReadoutError`,
    :class:`.CorrelatedReadoutError`.
