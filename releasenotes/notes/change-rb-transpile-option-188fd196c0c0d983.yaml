upgrade:
  - |
    The default transpile option value of ``optimization_level`` for RB experiments
    (:class:`~.StandardRB` and :class:`~.InterleavedRB`) was changed from ``0`` to ``1``
    in order to reduce the number of gates in transpiled circuit and hence
    circuit generation/excution time and circuit sample variance in P(0) value.
    This is not an API change but, after this change, you will observe slower decay curves
    than before if you use the default configuration. And if you want to reproduce the results
    you obtained before this change, you may need to set ``optimization_level=0`` with
    :meth:`set_transpile_options`.
