features:
  - |
    A new experiment class :class:`qiskit_experiments.library.MirrorRB` is 
    introduced. This class implements mirror randomized benchmarking (RB), a version 
    of RB that uses mirror circuits. It is more scalable than other RB protocols and
    can consequently be used to detect crosstalk errors. A similar class 
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.library.MirrorRBPyGSTi` is also introduced that uses
    ``pyGSTi`` circuit generation; it is primarily used for testing. 

fixes:
  - |
    Initial guess function for the randomized benchmarking analysis :func:`.rb_decay` has been
    upgraded to give accurate estimate of the decay function base.
