features:
  - |
    Improves handling of analysis callbacks in :meth:`.ExperimentData`.
    Logging information on execution of analysis callbacks in an experiment
    can enabled by setting the log level to DEBUG.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.jobs` method for returning a list of
    Qiskit Jobs for a running or run experiment.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.job_status` method for returning the status
    of Qiskit Job execution for an experiment.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.analysis_status` method for returning the status
    of analysis callback execution for an experiment.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.cancel_analysis` method to allow cancelling
    pending analysis callbacks. Note that analysis callbacks that have already
    started running cannot be cancelled.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.cancel` to cancel both jobs and analysis.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``timeout`` kwarg of :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_data` has been deprecated.
    To timeout waiting for job results use the ``timeout`` kwarg with
    :meth:`.ExperimentData.block_for_results` or
    :meth:`.ExperimentData.analysis_results` instead.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue with :meth:`.ExperimentData.block_for_results` sometimes
    having a race issue with all analysis callbacks finishing.
