features:
  - |
    Added a new visualization module to plot figures and draw onto figure canvases. The new module contains
    plotters and drawers, which integrate with :class:`.CurveAnalysis` but can be used independently of the
    analysis classes. This module replaces the old and now deprecated
    ``qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.visualization`` submodule.
  - |
    Added a new IQ plotting class :class:`.IQPlotter` for plotting IQ/level-1 data (individual 
    shots and their average) and a discriminator that classifies the data into
    states.
  - |
    Added a new ``image()`` method to :class:`.BaseDrawer` and :class:`.MplDrawer` to plot
    two-dimensional images on a figure canvas.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecated the :mod:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.visualization` submodule and replaced it with the new
    :mod:`qiskit_experiments.visualization` submodule.
