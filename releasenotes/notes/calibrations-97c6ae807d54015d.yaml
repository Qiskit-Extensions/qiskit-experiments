    Adds a collection of experiments for performing single-qubit gate
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization` and
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration`. The new experiments are

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.Rabi`: 
      This experiment scans the amplitude of a pulse and measures the qubit
      population. This allows us to determine the amplitude that creates,
      for example, an ``X`` gate and/or a ``SX`` gate.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.RoughXSXAmplitudeCal`:
      The calibration version of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.Rabi`.
      It extracts the amplitudes needed to implement an ``X`` gate an a ``SX`` gate.
      This type of calibration is a rough amplitude calibration since the resulting
      parameter value is typically not very precises.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineAmplitude`: This experiment repeats
      a rotation a variable number of times to amplify over- and under-rotations.
      The resulting ping-pong pattern in the qubit population is fit to determine
      the error in the rotation angle.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineXAmplitude`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineSXAmplitude`) gates.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineAmplitudeCal`: The calibration version
      of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineAmplitude`.
      It will update the amplitude of the pulse according to the measurred deviation.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineXAmplitudeCal`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineSXAmplitudeCal`) gates.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RoughDrag`:
      This experiment scans the DRAG parameter of a repeated
      sequence of rotation and anti-rotation. If the DRAG parameter does not have
      the correct value phase errors will accumulate and the repeated sequece of
      gates will not return the qubit to the ground state.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.RoughDragCal`: The calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RoughDrag`.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineDrag`: This experiment iterates the
      gate sequence Rp - Rm where Rp is a rotation around an axis and Rm is the same
      rotation but in the opposite direction. This sequence amplifies phase errors due
      to the presence of higher excited states.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineXDrag`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineSXDrag`) gates.
    
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineDragCal`: The calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineDrag`.
      This will update the DRAG parameter in the instance of the
      :class:`:class:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations` class.
      This experiment has specializations for X 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineXDragCal`) and SX 
      (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineSXDragCal`) gates.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.QubitSpectroscopy`: This experiment
      performs spectroscopy by applying a frequency shift to a long pulse. This experiment
      is typically used to identify the resonance frequency of the qubit.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.RoughFrequencyCal` the calibration
      version of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.QubitSpectroscopy`.
      This gives us a first rough estimate of the qubits frequency.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RamseyXY`: This experiment
      performs a Ramsey-XY experiment which allows us to measure the frequency of the qubit.
      This experiment is sensitive to the sign of the frequency offset from the main transition.
      It is a more precise measurement than spectroscopy.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FrequencyCal`: This is the calibration
      version of :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.RamseyXY`.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineFrequency`:
      This experiment performs an error amplifying sequence to measure the frequency of the qubit.
      This is done with delay instructions with a variable length and RZ gates.
      
    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.FineFrequencyCal`:
      This is the calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.FineFrequency`.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.HalfAngle`:
      This experiment measures the amount by which the SX and X gates are not parallel.
      Such errors can occur due to phase errors. For example,
      the non-linearities in the mixer's skew for :math:`\pi/2` pulses may be
      different from the :math:`\pi` pulse.

    * :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration.HalfAngleCal`:
      This is the calibration version of
      :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization.HalfAngle`.

    Added support for JSON serialization to
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BasisGateLibrary`.
  - |
    Simplified the update library for calibration experiments by merging
    this functionality into the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment`.
    
    Future releases may fully deprecate the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.update_library.BaseUpdater`
    in favour of moving its functionality into the
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``BackendCalibrations`` class has bas been removed and its functionality
    has been merged into the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations` class. Users
    should now use the :class:`Calibrations`
    class which can be instantiated from a backend by using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations.from_backend`
    method.
developer:
  - |
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.calibration` experiments have been changed
    so that each experiment is a subclass of a
    :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.library.characterization` experiment.
    
    Calibration experiments should now be constructed as subclasses of both
    the relevant characterization experiment and the new
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment`
    abstract base class.
  
    This new base class implements the functionality to manage schedules
    stored in instances of the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations` class and
    implements a framework where calibration experiments can specify an
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.BaseCalibrationExperiment.update`
    method to update the parameters that they are designed to calibrate.
