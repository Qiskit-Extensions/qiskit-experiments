features:
  - |
    Added the ``replace_results`` kwarg to
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.run` with default
    value of ``replace_results=False``.
    
    If analysis is run with ``replace_results=False`` and
    the experiment data being analyzed already contains analysis results or
    figures then a copy with a unique experiment ID will be returned containing
    only the new analysis results and figures. This copy can be saved as its
    own experiment to a database service.

    If analysis is instead run with ``replace_results=True`` then any analysis results
    and figures in the experiment data will be cleared and replaced with the
    new analysis results. Saving this experiment data will replace any
    previously saved data in a database service using the same experiment ID.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseAnalysis.run` to run
    asynchronously using the 
    :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.add_analysis_callback`.
    Previously analysis was only run asynchronously if it was done as part of
    an experiments :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.BaseExperiment.run`.
fixes:
  - |
    Changed :meth:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.ExperimentData.analysis_results`
    to automatically block for any running analysis callbacks before returning
    analysis results. This is to prevent issues where calling this method
    while analysis was still running would raise an exception that analysis
    results could not be found.
