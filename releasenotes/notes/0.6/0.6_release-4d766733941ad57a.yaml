    Qiskit Experiments 0.6 adds numerous features and improvements. It is compatible with Qiskit 1.0.
    Notable changes include refactoring the analysis results to a Pandas dataframe, and refactoring
    curve fit data into a new :class:`ScatterTable` container based on dataframes that is stored
    by default as an artifact in :class:`ExperimentData` along with the summary of fit results.
    New experiments include :class:`StarkP1Spectroscopy`, :class:`StarkRamseyXY`,
    :class:`StarkRamseyXYScan`. The supported provider for running jobs on IBM backends has 
    switched from ``qiskit-ibm-provider`` to ``qiskit-ibm-experiment``.
