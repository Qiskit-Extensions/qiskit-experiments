    Curve analysis has been updated to consider the fit parameter covariance in the error propagation.
    Now all result figures show the confidence interval of 1 sigma that is visualized
    as a semitransparent filled-area around the bold fit line. The width of the area corresponds to the
    standard deviation computed by the uncertainties of fit parameters with the covariance matrix.
    All analysis outcomes derived from the fit parameters also have a standard error computed in the same way.
