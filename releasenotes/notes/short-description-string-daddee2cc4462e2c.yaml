    List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.

    Added minimal working code examples to the API pages for each experiment,
    especially in characterizaion experiments. The minimal working code example
    is a code snippet which users can copy and paste to run the experiment.
    Users are required to specify a backend in the code example. As a default,
    the backend is a simulator such as :class: `GenericBackendV2`.
    In some experiments, the backend is an IBM real device due to the
    `backend.defaults()` dependence of the code example.
