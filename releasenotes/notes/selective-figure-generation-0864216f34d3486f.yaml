    The ``generate_figures`` parameter has been added to composite experiments to control figure
    generation. By default, ``generate_figures`` is ``always``, meaning figures will always be generated.
    If ``generate_figures`` is set to ``selective``, then only figures for analysis results of bad
    quality will be generated. If ``generate_figures`` is set to ``never``, then figures will never be
    generated. This behavior can be overridden for individual analyses by setting the analysis option
    ``plot``. In the next release, the default behavior of ``generate_figures`` will change to ``selective``.

    Fixed a bug where setting the analysis option ``plot_raw_data`` to ``True`` still caused formatted data
    to be plotted.
