features:
  - |
    New experiment module :mod:`qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian`
    is added. This module contains experiments to characterize low level
    system properties, such as device Hamiltonian.
  - |
    The `Hamiltonian Error Amplifying Tomography` (HEAT) experiment has been
    added. This experiment consists of the base class
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.BatchHeatHelper`
    and :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.HeatElement`
    for the experiment developers to implement HEAT experiment
    for arbitrary generator and for specific interrogated error axis.

    The HEAT experiment specific to the ZX-type generator
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZXHeat` is also added
    along with pre-configured experiments for
    X (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZX90HeatXError`),
    Y (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZX90HeatYError`),
    Z (:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.hamiltonian.ZX90HeatZError`)
    error axis. These experiments are typically used to characterize
    the Cross Resonance gate Hamiltonian implementing the CNOT gate.
