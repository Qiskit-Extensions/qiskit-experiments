upgrade:
  - |
    For developpers. The handling of user provided initial guesss and fit boundaries in the
    :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.curve_analysis.CurveAnalysis` has been changed.
    A curve analysis subclass doesn't need to worry about user provided options, since
    the logic is updated so that these options are automatically applied in the following step.
    Note that the method name to provide these initial guess is also updated from
    ``_setup_fitting`` to ``_generate_fit_guesses`` to reflect the new behavior of the method.
    Please also update your curve analysis subclass to conform to the new name,
    otherwise the method will be never called.
