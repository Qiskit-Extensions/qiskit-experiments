   Implemented a new algorithm for rb_experiment. This algorithm transpiles all
   the Cliffords in advance, and stores them in a file. The rb circuits are 
   constructed from the transpiled Cliffords, and so we can avoid tranpiling
   the full circuits. In addition, compose and inverse operations are 
   computed using a mapping between Cliffords and numbers, making these 
   operations much faster. The mapping is also stored in a file.
